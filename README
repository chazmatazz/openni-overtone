# openni-overtone

Demo of OpenNI with Overtone, designed for a modern dance performance.

## Requirements

* Kinect
* (Optional) TouchOSC and an open WiFi network

## Usage

* Setup the Kinect. Follow the instructions for SimpleOpenNI (http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/wiki/Installation). 
* Test it (http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/) using Processing. If this fails, test OpenNI and NITE without Processing.
* Install Leiningen 2 (https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Upgrading). I am using Leiningen 2 for OpenGL support in quil (replace lein with lein2 below if necessary).
* Clone this project
* cd openni-overtone
* lein deps
* Stick the SimpleOpenNI JNI's into openni-overtone/native in the right location for your OS.
* connect the Kinect
* lein run -m openni-overtone.core

You probably want to setup Emacs for overtone, see (https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Overtone-in-Emacs). For lein2, instead of lein plugins, edit ~/.lein/project.clj as in (https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Upgrading).

Without TouchOSC, you will have to control things by editing core.clj. TouchOSC adds control of instrument volumes and the ability to take snapshots. To run TouchOSC, see the commands commented out at the end of core.clj.
