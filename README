# openni-overtone

Demo of OpenNI with Overtone. Doesn't sound great, but it gets you started.

## Usage

* Setup the Kinect. Follow the instructions for SimpleOpenNI (http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/wiki/Installation). 
* Test it (http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/) using Processing.
* Install Leiningen 2 (https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Upgrading). I am using Leiningen 2 for OpenGL support in quil.
* Clone this project
* cd openni-overtone
* lein2 deps
* connect the Kinect
* lein2 run -m openni-overtone.core

You will probably have problems with JNIs on the classpath. You may need to fix your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH (Mac).

You probably want to setup Emacs for overtone, see (https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Overtone-in-Emacs). However, for Leiningen 2, you want to run lein2 rather than lein. You can also just edit ~/.lein/project.clj as in (https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Upgrading).
